patch files to add obsidian notebook to the platform
obsidian is a markdown editor and documentation manager

obsidian will have the workspace from jupyterlab mounted
to allow working on the projects documentation without unnecessary
copying and mounting files outside the platform

see: [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

service was borrowed from the great obsidian vnc platform project [docker-obsidian](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-obsidian)
