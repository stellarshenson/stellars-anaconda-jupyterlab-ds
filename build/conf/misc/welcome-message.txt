Welcome to stellars-jupyterlab-ds platform. This is your environment intended
for data science and machine learning / ai projects. You will find a lot of
packagages installed and configured for you in such way that it just works.

In the workspace you will find the following helpful tools:
- workspace-git-*.sh: help you keep workspace git projects up to date
- test_cuda_tf_and_torch.py: test if tensorflow and pytorch can use your GPU
- cookiecutter-new-project.sh: create new data-science project using cookiecutter

Tensorflow version is 2.16.2 [cuda] and Torch version is 2.0 [cuda]
Tensorrt was not installed because of the license limitations
Follow https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt/download/10x to install

There were many useful scientific and machine learning packages preinstalled
You can always verify which of them are available in the platform by executing:
$ conda list

You can also find out about installed packages by inspecting:
- /environment.yml

Miniforge3 environment (conda) was installed in `/opt/conda`. 
Thanks to `nb_conda_kernels` extension, whenever you create a new environment
it will be available to you as a kernel in the jupyterlab environment

To execute commands as root use `sudo`, password is 'password' unless changed

This message will be displayed once every day.
